# Breast Cancer Detection Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately detect breast cancer based on key tumor cell characteristics.

## Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women, and early detection significantly increases survival rates. However manual tumor screening is tedious and prone to human error. This model automates analysis to identify malignant cancers faster.  

## Model Details

- Developed using Python and common data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and Keras
- Reads in and preprocesses breast cancer histology dataset from Kaggle
- Trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify tumors as malignant or benign
- Achieves over 85% classification accuracy on test data

## Methodology

1. Import libraries and data
2. Exploratory data analysis  
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Train/test split
5. Build deep learning CNN model 
6. Train model on training data
7. Evaluate model performance on test data

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate larger datasets to improve generalization 
- Test model accuracy on real-world clinical data
- Deploy model for practical screening and diagnosis
- Expand model for multi-class classification

## Usage

The model is in the 'ML_breast_cancer.ipynb' file.
